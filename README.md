# NuRS_Python_Executable
A test of python executable formats for testing machines in the NHS.

This repository contains the implementations for:

* Alignment
* Scrambling
* Combining

of data sets extracted inside NHS Trusts.

To the reader - the core python implementation is in the `nurs_routine` folder.  Each python script inside is a single standalone routine to produce a data set, using the tools implemeted in the `utilities` sub-directory.
